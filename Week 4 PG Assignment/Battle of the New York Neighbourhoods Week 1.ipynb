    "Businessmen are always attempting to expand their wealth by either growing their current companies or expanding their current portfolio in order to retrieve more streams of income. Ideally this is always informed through a complex decision matrix on possible expansion strategies they wish to pursue. Business ideas are brain stormed, the top ideas are selected and business plans are written out on a high level. The top business plans are further developed and eliminated as the level of detail increases and finally out of this entire process, an idea becomes a project which is pursued. Through many iterations and blending of business ideas, the final idea may not have been an idea from the iteration process but something that was concluded during the iteration stage. One of the important elements in refining a business idea is always to understand a market and potential customers. There are many traits that characterise potential customers such as lifestyle, income bracket, culture, beliefs, location, etc. By identifying the potential customers and characterising them, a potential investor is able to decide where they wish to pursure their next endevour. This is one of the many ways Data Scientists are able to use data to understand communities and better suggest products/services that will indeed be successful due to the fact that it makes lives easier for people. The most successful businesses are the ones that improve the quality of life for people and bring the most value to their respective customers."

    "Our client owns businesses across the world and have finally grown enough to infiltrate business into the New York area. The client hired our company to investigate various business opportunities in the new york area and provide them with our suggestions on the various business ventures they may partake in. As this is the first time that our client is looking into New York City, they require us to report on the various business opportunities we find and provide recommendations on what their strategy should be. As a Data Scientist within the company, we are required to understand the various areas within new york by understanding the current businesses that exist within new york and provide the strategy team with more locational information acccording to the neighbourhoods so that they can better support their business cases that they wish to recommend to the client."

    "Our data will make use of the FourSquare API and will gather the various types of businesses that exist within the various neighborhoods of New York. These businesses will then be categorised according to the types of businesses that they are such as restaurants, fast food, lifestyle, basic needs, etc. The locational data of New York will be retrieved through a geojson file. An article off the internet will also be used to scrape household income from respective neighborhoods from the internet as it will be interesting to observe the types of business that exist from neighbourhood trends due to income brackets. This will give us a better understanding of why some businesses exist within neighbourhoods and better understand the picture of how businesses operate within new york. Through the plotting of various graphs, the relationships between the neighbourhoods, income, and business will be seen easier which will help our client decide on the various businesses that need to be pursued according to the neighbourhood requirements as well as the various trends that exist between similar neighborhoods."
